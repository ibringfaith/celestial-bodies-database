# Celestial Bodies Database
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification. 

## Description
The goal of this project was to design a PostgreSQL database called universe. The database has information about galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and constellations. 

Each table in the database includes multiple data types (such as `VARCHAR`, `NUMERIC`, `BOOLEAN`, and `TEXT`), primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

## Database Structure
* galaxy: Information about different galaxies.
* star: Information about stars located in galaxies.
* planet: Information about planets orbiting stars.
* moon: Information about moons orbiting planets.
* constellation: Information about constellations in galaxies.

## Project Requirements
* 5 tables with at least 3 columns each
* Primary keys and foreign keys
* Unique and not-null constraints
* `BOOLEAN`, `TEXT`, `INT`, `NUMERIC`, and `VARCHAR` data types
* Sample data for all tables
